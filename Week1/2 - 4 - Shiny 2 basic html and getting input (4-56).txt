There's Main Panel.
Okay.
Here's example for R functions with
markup.
R functions will insert the HTML markup.
So, the header panel is going to say
illustrating markup, so remember that.
And then, you gotta remember that the
commas are what kill you with Shiny.
So, remember that you gotta have commas
between things.
And then you know, say, for example, no
comma right there.
So, h1, it's, this, I'm going to say h1 is
that
the sidebar panel, and then there's gotta
be a comma there.
h1 text, comma there, h2 text, comma
there, h3 text, comma there, and so on.
And so, all of these things will render in
the sidebar panel.
The main panel, I've got three things,
some main panel text, some
code formatted is the code and p, some
ordinary text right there.
Okay, so this is just a simple UI function
that shows the rendering.
So here's the illustrating markup
statement.
It rendered as H1.
And then in the sidebar it rendered the
sidebar panel, labeled right there
there's my H1 text, my H2 text, my H3
text, my H4 text, my main panel text.
Here's what it renders code like by
default.
And here's some ordinary text.
Okay and again this is, this is all
squashed, right,
the, the main, you know, when you do this
you'll
see that the, you'll see it looks, it
looks different,
there's, there's a lot more, white space
over in that direction.
Okay.
I wanted to show, an example of inputs.
So, remember, the header is going to say,
illustrating inputs.
The sidebar panel, I'm going to put in a
numeric input.
And you'll see what I mean by that.
So, a little box where you can enter in a
numeric input.
Here's the label so it's, it is exactly
the HTML label.
And then here's the printed label.
Numeric input labeled ID1.
Here's the, the default value, the minimum
and the maximum and a step value.
And you'll see what the step value does.
And then here's a check box.
It's labeled ID2.
I've put it in, I, I label it as called
check box.
And here's the, the different values that
it can give.
Here it is date input.
And then the main panel I'm just going to
leave blank in this example.
And here's, here's an examp, here, here's
the example.
When you run it, you'll see.
So, when you push this button, it's going
to increase
or decrease the numeric input as per the
step size.
And then here's the check box.
Right?
Check, check, check it.
And, and, and date when you click that
it'll
actually bring down, a calendar that you
can take.
Grab the date from and then, and then
here,
I wanted to show how you can grab the
output.
So, here, and, and display the output.
So here in h, h3 text and it'll say
illustrating output.
H4 will say you entered.
And then I'm going to say output.
ID 1 output ID 2 and, and output date,
okay?
And so that's how I'm going to render the
output, but notice I gotta
grab these oid 1, oid 2 and odate
variables, where do those come from?
Well, those come from your server
function.
And my server function just says, it takes
in my input, which is my input ID1.
So this is where it grabs the HTML labels,
right?
ID1, ID2 and date.
And then here, render print is just saying
I,
that output is, is going to be formatted
as printed text.
So output oid1 is going to be printed to,
just reprinting the input ID, and so on.
Okay?
And, here we go.
So here, you know, here you see.
So here you can see it.
It starts at default value zero.
I could, I could press up and down on that
zero to change the outputs over here.
You know, whatever you check over here.
So I check the two values and you'd see
they
come out over here as you entered one and
two.
The zero is you entered zero.
And then I clicked, clicked the date which
I think was actually
the date I was doing this and it says you
entered that date.
Okay?
Okay, and here it is actually live.
So in my art studio I typed run app in the
directory
that contained this code, this code is in
the get hub repository.
And you can see as I enter in numeric
input
as I increase it to five, it's changed to
five
over there, I check value one, value two,
value three,
value two, value one, I can grab the new
date.
Okay.
Okay, so that's just what it, that's
showing how you can
get from your inputs to the server, then
back to the.
