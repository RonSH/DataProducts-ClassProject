Okay so, let, let me go through showing an
image.
How to embed an image.
So and then let's put a slider on it.
The, the, we're going to create a
histogram and put a
slider on it so that the user has to guess
the means.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create in my
Side Bar panel a slider input, mu, is
going to be my label.
I'm going say, guess the mean.
You're going to start at a value of 70.
It's going to slide from 62 to 74.
And the step size is going to be 0.05.
And then, muHist in my main panel is not
defined in this file.
It's defined in my server.R file where I
define it as
the histogram I create based on my, the
calculations that get done.
Okay.
So new hist is my label for my output
created for my server.R function.
Here is my server.R function.
so, it's telling them the data set that I
need to grab,
any library calls, So here render plot is
like render print only it's going to
render a plot.
Here's my histogram, and then here's the
just some
generic rcode, it grabs the input value,
it adds lines at that input value and
then I, I give the person their mean
squared error and I
tell them what their mu value and their
main squared error is.
This all gets rendered in a variable
called newHist in my output,
so the newHist will be the HTML label that
the UI function is calling.
And it looks something like that.
So there, there, there you go.
And let's see it in action.
Okay, here it is in a tab for Chrome.
Here's my slider.
I'm going to change it and see it changes
my red line.
And here's my mu value, and my mean
squared error.
Right?
And so, that's a nice little function that
you can do.
And it shows how you would, how it's
rendering the image.
So, okay.
So, what's happening, right, is my ui.r is
telling
Shiny to create an HTML page with the
slider.
The slider creates a, a something a thing
with a label.
That label receives the numeric input
value.
That input value is passed to server.R.
Server.R gives the instructions back to
render the markup,
giving it the plot and the output values,
right, that go, go
back with the instructions from UI.R to
giving it on how to mark it up.
okay.
Very neat, right?
