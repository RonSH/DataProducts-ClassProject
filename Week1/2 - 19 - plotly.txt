Hi my name is Bryan Kaffow and welcome to
the Coursera Data Products class first
lecture on Plotly.
So Plotly is a platform for creating
interactive graphics and dealing analysis.
However, we're going to focus on Plotly as
it interacts with R.
So in this way it will be not unlike
what we're getting out of R charts in
googleVis.
The difference is Plotly will interact
with a specific web platform.
So the first step on Plotly is to create
an account
or link Plotly with one of your existing
accounts like GitHub.
I created a new account.
After that, I think, probably, it's best
to click on the learn button here.
And then it goes through a bunch of
documentation on Plotly.
I'm interested in R, so I'm going to go
down here.
And I'm particularly interested because I
being kind of into
ggplot2 lately, clicking how to interact
between Plotly and ggplot.
So, click on the Getting Started button
here.
It takes you to a webpage that I found
particularly useful.
For getting started with the Plotly R API.
So first you need to have installed
devtools, which, I think,
at this point in the class, you should
have already have done.
Then you want to do library devtools.
And then you want to install the Plotly
package from GitHub.
And that's in the location ropensci/plotly
given here.
Then you want to initialize plotly with
library plotly, and
then you'll unload some other packages
like Rcurl and RJSONID etcetera.
Next the Plotly website gives you a set
credential command.
You should run that command in your R
console.
And you should only have to do that once.
If you can't find it and it will give you
the
correct command with the correct key, if
you're logged into Plotly.
If you need to set a new key for whatever
the
reason and if for example if you
accidentally show your key to
thousands of people during a data products
class, then you can click
on your name in Plotly to settings and
then reset the key.
So here you actually get a brief glimpse
into my actual day job.
So what I do most of the time during the
day is think about so called brain kind of
activities.
So here's the results of these sorts of
large dimensional decompositions that.
That we like to think about and I'm using
R studio's
manipulate and this is a nice motivation
for R studio's manipulate function.
Here it sort of flips through latent
factors of this decomposition
and this flips through axial slices of the
brain.
And this changes the statistical threshold
that I'm using to control the overlay.
So at any rate, that's what I actually do
during the day.
I would also add here, let me show you an
example that motivates why you might need
something like Plotly.
Here's another use of the manipulative
function.
So those are the images, there are some
associated loadings that occur.
And here, what you often want to do is
flip though the loadings
in this case, and if you see an instance
like this, where there is
a lot of nice variability in the loadings,
but there's one subject that's sticking
way out, it'd be nice if I could just
hover over that one subject.
Like here and figure out what subject that
is because then when
I go back to the original brain imaging
data there's usually a mistake.
Like this one for sure there's probably
some
mistake for this person's brain image at
some point.
And so I'd like some interactivity where
if I hover my mouse over this, so I
don't have to code to figure out what that
one is because I'm going back and forth.
And things like Plotly and RCharts and
googleVis are particularly good at that.
So let's go through an example.
So on the GitHub repository I have this
data set, courseraData.rda, which you can
load up.
Up here I've already loaded it up.
And that contains enrollment numbers for
our Coursera
classes before we started the data science
specialization.
And I would do the library plotly, and
then
library ggplot2, because I want to create
a ggplot.
So, I'm going to create my ggplot where my
y
is enrollment, my x is which class it is,
and my fill is which offering it.
Was first offering, second offering, third
offering.
And then I give it my data frame, my data.
And then that creates the sort of blank
ggplot canvas, and then I'm going to add
a bar graph where the statistic is the
identity statistic and there, I'm going to
plot it.
So there it is nice, and in the RStudio
plotting window.
Though of course notice when I hover the
bars, nothing happens.
Okay, so let's now try and import it into
Plotly.
What I do is I create a variable that is
the output of the Plotly command
and then if I were to run this command
here, take the variable that I output.
Do ggplotly.
Which is this interface between ggplot and
Plotly.
And then I pass it my ggplot which I
confusingly named g.
And I run that, it will take me to Plotly.
It'll open up a new browser window with
that plot in it.
And I'm going to assign it to a variable.
And the reason I, why I'm going to assign
it to a variable because I might
want to refer back to this, is you can
grab the Plotly URL from that variable.
So out is the, what I'm assigning this
output to, dollar sign response dollar
sign URL.
Will give you that url associated with the
Plotly plot.
So let's do it.
Okay.
There we go.
There it brought up my new browser window.
And then let me just go back here and just
show you how I can get the, the URL.
Okay.
But now let me also look at my Plotly
plot.
And, notice it's a bar plot.
Okay, but notice it has some of the
interactivity
that was actually not present, in my
original ggplot.
So let's, look at this plot for a minute.
So this class right here is a case-based
introduction to Biostatistics taught by
the great Biostatistician Scott Zeger
who's in
our department here, and that has 20,000.
If it ever runs again you get it, you
should take it because you get
a chance to really take a class from one
of the best Biostatisticians out there.
Roger's computing for data analysis class
which now is
sort of superseded by the R programming
class in specialization.
Had runs of 50,000, 44,000, 80,000 and
65,000 and if you stack them up like
this you see that Roger's total enrollment
is about 250,000 from his collection of
courses.
Jeff Lee is sort of the Justin Timberlake
of our little boy band here and he's had a
single class with over 100,000 in it and
its
first data analysis class, and 91,000 in
the second running.
I'm sort of Mr. Consistent here
in Mathematics Biostatistics Boot Camp 1,
with
16,000, 22,000, 18,000, and 18,000 fairly,
very
consistent but pedestrian performance by
corsair standards.
And in Boot Camp 2, which is the sequel of
this class, gets much lower enrollment
10,000 and close to 7,000.
So it's kind of interesting dataset.
But, let's also play around.
Let's see, Save and Edit.
So, if I click on Save and Edit, they'll
take me to
a new window where I can edit my Plotly
plot.
From the Plotly website so let's just do
one quick example.
I think you can load up the website and
play around with it.
I hope I've given you enough to get
started here.
But let's take for example a theme.
So, for example if I want to change a
color theme of my existing plot.
This pineapple looking clock well, it does
feel a
great deal more tropical to me which is
good.
And then I can switch between say this
stacked bar chart and a staggered bar
chart.
So I don't actually have to go back to the
R coding.
Right, so not, not terribly unlike our
example in
R charts when we did exactly the same
thing.
So I have my graph set how I like.
I think I like the original stacked bar
chart better,
and Plotly really has in mind things like
sharing your graph.
It's kind of a social graphing platform
more than anything else.
And so if you click on share, you
can click share on Twitter or Facebook
right here.
