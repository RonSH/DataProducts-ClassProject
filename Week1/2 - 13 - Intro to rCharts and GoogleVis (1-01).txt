My friend Jeff has a problem that impacts
nine out of ten statisticians.
He makes static boring non-interactive
graphs.
And interactivity in graphs is more than
just
about eye candy, it's about giving the
user control.
In a way that makes it easy for them to do
some of the manipulations
that the programmer can do without having
all the overhead of actually writing the
program.
And new tools in R like rCharts and
googleVis make creating interactive
highly engaging plots much easier, so that
users don't have to learn complex
tools like D3, now Jeff's presentations
really jump off the screen.
And with his new dance moves,
his presentations are really something to
behold.
