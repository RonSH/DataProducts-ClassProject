Hi.
My name is Brian Cathell, and welcome to
the Coursera class, Data products.
This is part of our Coursera
specialization in data science,
and it's co-taught by my co-instructors,
Jeff Leak and Roger Payne.
We're all in the department of
Biostatistics at
the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of
Public Heath.
So what is a data product?
A data product is any App, or
software, or presentation, or reproducible
report based on
data or something that helps people
analyze a
common form of data, like in our package.
In this class, we'll talk about all
different
sorts of data product, such as how to
create a Slidify lecture, how to use our
studio presenter, how to create a Shiny
App.
A Shiny is creates little web Apps using
R.
How to create an R package, how to use R
charts and create interactive graphics,
and many other tools for creating
impressive data products quickly.
