Okay, so let's talk about how you get
your shinyapps.io account for creating
your course project.
You want to go to www.shinyapps.io/
coursera.
The, our studio folks want to, you know,
get
some numbers on how many people are coming
from Coursera
and have some of a special log in process,
but it looks identical to an ordinary
ShinyApps account otherwise.
Then you just want to click on create an
account.
You can pick to link your account to
GitHub or Google.
Since you already have a GitHub account
for
the class, you might as well just use
GitHub.
When you click on it, it will have an
access request from GitHub.
And if you're logged into GitHub, it will
automatically
log you into your ShinyApps using your
GitHub login.
So it takes you to this page and it says,
hi, you must be new here.
And it talks about needing to install
ShinyApps and R Package.
And there's this handy little Getting
Started
Guide you should click on right here.
The first thing it wants you to do, is to
install devtools.
If you've made it this far in the class
without having to install dev, devtools,
I'm quite surprised.
However, nonetheless, you can get devtools
directly from CRAN with the
install.packages.
I would say if you're in Windows, I'm not
sure
if this devtools requires it, but I would
also install Rtools,
which is the collection of Windows
executables that has a
bunch of Unix style commands to help you
build R packages.
So, let's assume you have devtools
installed, and
with devtools you can install directly
from GitHub.
And that's what this command right here
says.
Install devtools::install_github.
R studio shinyapps, that will install the
shinyapps package.
You should also have Shiny installed,
which you
can get directly from CRAN as well with
install.packages.
CRAN, Shiny.
Then going back to ShinyApps.io, you'll
probably of noticed
the secret key and this little two buttons
right
here, one will show you your key, secret
key,
and the other one will copy it to the
clipboard.
You want to click on copy it to the
clipboard, and that'll copy a set of
commands.
You want to go back to R and paste those
into the command line.
Now deploying your app is staggeringly
easy.
You want to make sure you've done library
ShinyApps, that you're in the directory
with
your shiny application, that you've done
run
app, and made sure that it works locally.
And then now it's time to deploy it.
You simply type deployApp() and if you've
gotten
your se, secret key typed in correctly and
you've
created your account correctly, then it
will deploy the app on the shiny server.
It'll, it'll actually take a little bit of
time,
where it goes through a bunch of checks
and
things like that, but then, you can then
check
on the shinyapps.io website to make sure
that it's running.
So here's the result from my account when
I typed in deployapp for that
simplest app that was in the GitHub
repository, for the class.
You can see here, get my pen, you can
see here, that it is that app name
simplestApp.
Then right here, you have a couple things
that you can look at.
Dashboard, which is, is shown right here.
We'll click on applications in a second.
And then accounts is all account settings.
So I have one app running.
I have zero pending.
I have zero archived.
Now, this one that's running, let's look
at our
applications by clicking on applications
and see what it says.
Okay.
So, here is the name of that app that's
running.
That link will pop open a new window and
actually show you the app as it's running.
It gives you it's is, it gives you it's
status and so on.
And over here it can show you the ones
that are running, pending, and archived.
