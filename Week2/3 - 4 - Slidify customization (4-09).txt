Okay, so, one thing you need to know about
Slidify is
how do you kind of specify some of the
main options.
So the, the way you do it is with this so
called YAML at the beginning of
the slide, so YAML is what stands for
YAML, yet another mark down lang-,
yet, yet another mark down language, or
something like that.
Anyway, it's this specific format, where
you
have a bunch of fields of parameters, and
then a colon, and then the values that
they take, with the pound sign meaning
comment.
okay, so, you know, here's title, would
just be the title
of your presentation, subtitle would be
the subtitle of your presentation.
And the slide framework.
And the highlighter.
We'll talk about this, the framework will,
will do the formatting for you.
So, it'll to, decide what size the title
is rendered at.
What size the subtitle.
Author is you.
You know, write your name, your job is,
your job
you can leave some of these, you can leave
these blank.
The highlighter talks about some of the
effects.
And the theme is, again, a theme.
You can play around with those and see
what they do.
The, the widgets talks about some
mathjaxes for math, mathmat, mathematical
equation rendering.
Quiz is for these kind of automated quiz
things.
Bootstrap is the Twitter bootstrap style.
Which is CCS style that I guess Twitter
created.
The mode you know, the, the mode will
depend on where and when you intend to
give the presentation so you know, if you
would, you would use a different one, for
example.
Self contained, or draft, or stand alone.
Depending on whether or not you would have
Internet
access while you're giving the
presentation, and so on.
if, if you know, Slidify will grab all of
the libraries and copy them, or it can, it
can read them directly off of the Internet
at the time of giving the presentation.
Just like JavaScript.
You can either have JavaScript loaded in
the, you know, you know,
if you have JavaScript saved in some files
that the webpage is importing.
You can have it saved locally or you could
grab it from some other source.
Okay, so.
Let's see, so this just repeats what I've
already said.
The highlighter, oh yeah, and, and I
should have mentioned the code, the
highlighter
is the code highlighter, and we'll go
through some code examples in a minute.
There's some other fields you can, you can
use, for example, if
you have a specific place you want your
assets direct, directory to be.
If you have a logo and you want it loaded
in, and so on,
but you know, I think a lot of these are
kind of
options that you will kind of, learn as
you need to learn
them.
So, this is the YAML for the presentation
I'm actually giving right now.
Well it's not exactly the presentation,
because I pretended like I wrote
it, when in fact, Jeff actually wrote
these slides, for the most part.
[SOUND]
so.
What, so what do you do then?
Okay, after you've done editing your
YAMLs, you've got kind of
a slide style that you're interested in,
and you could go through
Ramnes web site, or a lot of the, there's
tons of
Slidify information on the Internet to
find different themes that you like.
And so on.
This is in the IO theme.
Google IO theme, which was created by
Google for one of their developer
conferences.
And and it's, it has been an open source,
so a lot of us use it.
So the nice thing about mark down is, is
for example,
if you want an ordered list, you just
write one, two, three.
And then, when you Slidify this list, it
renders
it as, as an HTML ordered list, enumerated
list.
