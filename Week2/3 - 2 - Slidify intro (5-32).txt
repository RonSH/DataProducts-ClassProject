Hi, my name is Brian Caffo, I'm a
professor in
the Department of Biostatistics at the
Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of
Public Health, and this is the lecture on
Slidify in
the Coursera data science specialization,
part of the data products class.
This class and all the other classes in
the specialization
are co-taught with my co-instructors Jeff
Leek and Roger Peng.
Okay, so what is Slidify?
Slidify is a way to create data centered
presentations.
It was created by Ramnath, who's a friend
of ours and we like quite a bit.
And it streamlines this process of
creating and present,
creating presentations so that if you
update data or
update functions that, that all you have
to do
is recompile the presentation, and it gets
updated as well.
So what Slidify really is, is it's an
amalgamation of knitr,
Markdown a bunch of JavaScript libraries
and HTML5 slide decks.
So you might have seen if you're very
familiar with some modern HTML
presentations there's kind of a thriving
community
developing very nifty HTML HTML5 slide
decks.
And Slidify is leveraging that and then
making it
so that you don't have sort of know all
the ends and outs of, of HTML5 and
JavaScript,
that you can just do it directly in R.
Slidify is very customizable, and it's
easy
to use because you basically write in
Markdown,
which if you haven't used Markdown before,
it's
a tremendously simple watered down version
of HTML.
Or, not version of HTML, watered down,
sort of HTML-type language.
So Slidify allows embedded code chunks
that render quite nicely.
It also allows mathematical formulas, and
what
that really means is that the JavaScript
library MathJax correctly renders the
mathematical formulas,
and you type them out in LaTeX.
So if you're an academic like me, and
you're used to LaTeX that's really great.
So anyway, Slidify presentations, when
you're done, are just html files.
So you can view them with any web browser,
and you can share them very easily.
And it's a, it's a nice way to, to, to
give a presentation.
I find it's actually quite nice when I go
give presentations to do them in
Slidify because usually there's already at
the lectern and I just go to a website.
I usually host the Slidify presentation
off, directly off of GitHub.
And, so I usually don't even have to bring
a, a, a drive to transfer my presentation
on.
Okay.
So getting Slidify.
So, it's super easy.
Fire up R, or RStudio.
I like to do it in RStudio.
Make sure you have devtools installed,
which is on Cran, so if you, if you, You
can do installed out packages to get dev
tools, oh in fact here's the command right
there.
And you want to make sure it's loaded, so
library dev tools.
Then you need to install Slidify.
Ramnath is really developing very
actively, so
he doesn't seem to put it on Cran.
It's still on GitHub.
So you can do install.github, which is a
function from Devtools and
Slidify and that's the user name that it's
looking for in GitHub.
And then Slidify Libraries is just exactly
as it sounds:
a bunch of library files that Slidify
needs to run.
And then you load Libraries Slidify, so
now let's start creating some slides.
so, you, you, can, you should start by,
setting the working directory
into the project where you want the, the
project to be contained.
I, you know, I actually kind of like doing
this in our studio now.
Instead of doing setwd, I just do session
and then set
setting to working directory to the file
that I'm working on.
So create your project name and, and, and,
you can, you can
type all the commands in to, for a basic
Slidify document.
But I find it easier, is to just use the
so-called author command.
If you just do author("first_deck"),
it'll, kind of populate a somewhat
empty Slidify document for you, for you to
start filling in.
It'll put in a little bit just to remind
you what the commands are.
So what does it do, what does it cause to
happen?
Well, a directory name of your project is
created inside of your current directory.
Inside this directory is an assets
directory
and a file a file called index.rmd.
That's the Markdown file you'll create to
edit your Slidify documents.
And then the assets directory is populated
with a bunch of empty folders for
CSS that's the style sheets image files,
JavaScripts, and layouts, JavaScript code
and layouts.
And so, what you're going to do is, is
populate this
R Markdown file and then run Slidify to
run it.
So
so any, any of the customization you
should put in those directories.
And if you're not really terribly familiar
with
web development then I wouldn't bother
with those.
You can just sort of dig around for style
and maybe use other people's open source
style files
But if you really know, then that's where
you would dig around.
Okay.
