Okay, let's try this out.
Up here you're seeing the Slidify from the
talk that I was just giving.
Or the lecture I was just giving.
But, let's try authoring a new one.
So I've done library slidify to make sure
it's loaded in.
[SOUND] There we go.
Alright.
Let's, Let's see.
Oh, it's author, right?
Author test.
Let me just try that, test.
Oh man that looks good.
[NOISE] let's see.
Oh look over here.
There's tests.
Let's look at that file, the index.rmd
file.
There we go.
Lets put in a title.
Test title.
Okay.
Subtitle, sub test title.
Author, me.
Job, well, my real job is kind of messing
around on the internet, but, so I'll just
put internet.
Okay.
alright.
Read and delete.
Let's keep that where it's at, keep all
that stuff where it's at.
But let me just put a little test thing
there,
test slide two, just to make sure it does
slide two.
Alright, I've saved it, alright.
Oh look, and it gave a little thing here
that reminds me that it switched to the
slide directory.
Alright, so I'm going to cu-, I'm going to
try slidify.
Look, it can autocomplete index.R
markdown.
See look what, what it did.
It processed the R code.
It copied a bunch of frameworks and the
highlighter that's, that's
from the eamle up here, we'll talk about
that in a minute.
But then now let's I actually like, I like
to
have Knitr loaded when I work on Slidify
because there's
this function browse URL and then I can
just browse
the, just type browse index.html it brings
up my Slidify deck.
There we go.
There we go.
Looks good.
Really, really good.
