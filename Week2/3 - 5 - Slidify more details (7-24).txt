[SOUND] A slide in Slidify is demarked by
the 3 dashes at
the in between, they need to be in a line
all by themselves.
I, I find in Slidify the often the biggest
way I'm messing things up, is
I have text that's sort of touching when
it needs a new line in between it.
So, you know, always check that.
The two pound signs have a, there's,
there, there's I think it's 2 pound signs
I believe is H1, the HTML equivalent of H,
H1, when it, the mark down gets rendered.
Let's see, these like .class pound ID.
This is how you can add slide, slide
specific
options to that, to that slide, in slide
of [UNKNOWN].
It looks like this kind of format here
but, but before you do that, I would
get used to just using ordinary Slidify
before
you started messing around with the slides
specific changes.
okay.
Then, when you're done, you compile your R
markdown file with Slidify.
We've seen how to do that.
And then, if you have knitr installed you
can do browseURL.
If not, you can just open up Explorer or
whatever it's called and whatever or,
operating system you're using, and
double-click on the
HTML file, it'll bring it up for you.
[BLANK_AUDIO].
And by the way, after you've recompiled,
after
you've reslidified it, you then, you can
just
switch over to your browser and type
Control
R, or Apple R, or whatever refreshes the
page.
You don't have to actually reload the
slide every time.
[BLANK_AUDIO].
Okay.
So, how do you publish things?
Well,
there's a couple of ways you can do it.
So you have, a, you know, if you do it as
stand-alone, for example.
You just have stand-alone HTML with all
the libraries in a file there.
You can put it on wherever.
If, you, you know, if you have some space
to host it on the web.
If you want to publish it to GitHub, you,
you can create a new empty repository and
then
Slidify has a command that's just publish
GitHub
user, then the repo that you want it in.
And if you're one of the people like us
that actually often host
websites off of GitHub, yeah, using GitHub
pages, then this is particularly nice,
because not only can you put the Slidify
code in the HTML on
GitHub but you can actually web host it
off of GitHub as well.
So some, that's the easy way.
Slidify has some other ways of publishing
if, if you
have a public Dropbox folder it will copy
it to Dropbox
and then, you know, just like you can host
an
HTML file off of Dropbox you can do it
that way.
You can put the HTML file wherever you'd
like.
I tend to use GitHub but you know, there's
there's other options as well.
You know, if you can, you can actually
just send the HTML file, the, the, the
zip, zipped up directory to someone if you
want to never have it be hosted on the
internet.
So there's different frameworks.
Here's some of the different frameworks.
I tend to use IO so I, that was first.
But they, you know, some of these HTML
effects are actually pretty fancy.
So you should check 'em out.
They're, a lot of 'em are really neat.
[UNKNOWN] is pretty easy if you have
reason to include math.
So if you do X squared in single dollar
signs
you get X raised to the power of 2, like
that,
or X carry 2 is X raised to the power
2, your YAML has to have Mathjax loaded in
the widgets.
Mathjax is a mathematics rendering
JavaScript library, so here
is an example right here of putting, the
quadratic formula.
[BLANK_AUDIO].
There we go.
Let's see.
If you, if you actually, if you actually
want to do some more advanced HTML then
what what Markdown lets you do, just try
putting the HTML in the Markdown file.
99% of the time that just works.
so, that's like, you know, images or
tables where if you want more
control than Markdown actually gives you,
then you might just include the raw HTML.
also, you know you can, you can always
edit the final HTML, slide
deck that you get out of Slidify, but you
know, again, I wouldn't,
you know, I wouldn't say this is the best
solution like if you're
going to do that why not have just coded
in HTML to begin with?
The whole point of doing Slidify is that
you can embed your R Code.
But anyway, it's sometimes useful in a
pinch if you're, you know,
frantically preparing course slides at the
last minute like me and you
just have something that you can't change,
and you can't figure out
how to do in Slidify but you know how to
use the HTML.
And then you can do whatever else you
normally do in a web page after you're
done.
But again, it, it, you know, it's, you
know, to to me, it it ruins a lot of the
utility of Slidify if you don't you know,
do it
with the sl, do basically everything with
the Slidify command.
There's a lot better web development
solutions if you're removing the condition
that you want com, to compile the R code
along with the presentation.
If you, if you, if you remove
that requirement, then there's so many web
authoring
tools that, that I, I don't think
at that point Slidify wouldn't be
competitive anymore.
The only reason is, is to use it for this
specific purpose where you're using R.
Or may, you know, maybe if you happen to
be
familiar with R and not too familiar with
other web technologies.
So it's actually kind of interesting, you
you can add interactive elements to
Slidify.
You can add things like quiz questions,
you can have it where the web
page can accept quiz questions, and give
hints and it has a very nice format.
You can add in, interactive R chart plots,
you can add Shiny apps,
you know of course all these things are,
you know, standard HTML things.
You can do it directly with the HTML
slash JavaScript but ramness has coded
this directly
into Slidify, and I give the link here
where you can see some of these examples.
So, you know, we'll do one.
[BLANK_AUDIO].
So here's the R markdown syntax.
Right, so here's the R markdown syntax,
yeah, I
would just write question 1, what's 1 plus
1?
I would say, here's my set of answers, and
I'd
put, underscores around 2 here, because
that's the correct answer.
I'd put a hint of this form and I put an
explanation of this form and that's the
the slide syntax, okay, that I would use,
and
then it looks like this when it comes up.
So if I do 1, and I try submit answers it
says no
you're wrong, if I try 3, submit answer,
it says no you're wrong.
If I try 4, submit it, no, you're wrong.
Darn it, this is a hard question.
Maybe I could ask for a hint.
It says this is a hint.
That's a pretty useful hint, now I know
the answer is 2.
And then now I can submit and show the
answer,
which might drop down an explanation,
except it's getting chopped
off because of how I'm recording the
screen, but it
just says this is an explanation, it's got
a little okay.
The style here is the Twitter, Twitter
boot strap style.
[BLANK_AUDIO].
You can clear it and try it again, this
time I'm confident I can get the right
answer.
