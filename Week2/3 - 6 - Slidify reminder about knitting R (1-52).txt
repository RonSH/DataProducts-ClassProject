Okay, so, having taken the reproducible
research class, everyone
in this class knows how to use Knitter,
but
let's just, you know, briefly go through,
[SOUND] using
Spotify, [SOUND] embedding a simple R
command into Spotify.
So, let me just do, I want to do [SOUND] 1
: 10, I want to do [SOUND] sum (1 : 10).
And, a friend told me that, that has to be
[SOUND] 10 * (11) / 2.
So I'm going to check that out.
[SOUND] Okay, and so, oh, by the way, you
know, you can just do knitHTML.
Knit the document, [SOUND] right?
And, that's also something, and it brings
up the preview, right?
It brings up, [SOUND] the preview.
So there's our thing.
There's this.
Okay, so it says, sum 1 : 10, 55, 10 times
11 divided by 2, 55.
Okay.
All right, and it has the same options
[SOUND] as.
Ordinary knitr.
So, you know, and you get auto complete
in, in
R studio, [SOUND] so you can see 'em for
example.
You could, you could do echo equals
[SOUND] FALSE.
Save it, [SOUND] knit the HTML, and now
look it only puts out the output.
Okay, right, or you could do.
Echo equals true, [SOUND] but, results
[SOUND] equals hide.
Right?
And then do it and then now it just, puts
the commands without the results.
Okay.
And if you want just some code [SOUND]
that it doesn't evaluate, you can just
say,
[SOUND] you know, if you just want some
r code that, [SOUND] that it doesn't
evaluate.
You add some, something, that looks like
code right here,
you know, you can always just do, [SOUND]
something like that.
[SOUND].
And then it won't, it won't evaluate it
[SOUND].
