Compile it to get the way you want it to.
Okay, so here's the big question, which is
Slidify
versus R Studio Presenter, and I was a
little
surprised when I first saw R Studio
Presenter because
it has a lot of overlap with Slidify, and.
So it, it my first question was why, why
do these two things exist?
Why not just either one group or the other
just adopt the other one.
So here's my impression.
So Slidify, to me, gives you a lot more,
more flexible control from the R Mark Down
file.
So you have a ton of kind of more of just,
options, as you play around with the
R marked down file or what in R Studio
Presenter is called the R pres file.
And it's really undergoing constant rapid
development, ranmith is
a mad man and he is constantly developing
it.
It has a larger user base, which mean,
like, there's lots of questions answered
on Stack Exchange.
And Ramnath seems to jump on Stack
Exchange almost immediately.
And he put in lots of styles and options
by default, so
you can, you have all the different HTML5
slide decks are basically included.
and, you know, you can, you can.
You, you can do them all fairly easily.
There's a much steeper learning curve to
go from
zero to functional in Slidify, a much
steeper learning curve.
And it's and I would describe it as more
kind of command line oriented.
Our studio is much, our Studio Presenter
is much more integrated within our studio.
and, and it's probably preferable to, to
work with the R
Studio GUI, so it's, the R Studio
Presenter is embedded in R Studio.
Which is a good and bad thing.
If you're more of a command line person,
you probably maybe want
the kind of way which Slidify has
implemented a little bit more.
Although, I'm confident there's probably a
way you can do most
of the R Studio things from the command
line as well.
so, but I think of it as more GUI
oriented.
R Studio Presenter is ridiculously easy to
get started.
I basically knew nothing and created this
presentation and lecture in one day.
And, it, it just one thing that struck me
about our
studio presenter relative to Slidify was
how easy it was to learn.
Now, to be fair, I knew Slidify first so I
had a lot of knowledge to build on,
but just my impression of the software is
that it is extremely easy to use.
[COUGH] And part of the reason it's easy
to use is it has a much
smaller set of kind of canonical styles
and options.
Right?
So you know, this kind of paradox of
choice type thing where
we actually are a little bit happier if we
have less choice.
That's how the Apple Store works, right?
You know, they give you relatively few
choices, and it
turns out people are happier if they have
fewer choices.
Or, so that's the lore.
I don't know if that's true at all.
But at any rate, this makes me happy that
there's fewer
choices, because I'm the kind of person
that, if there's lots
of choices, I tinker around with them and
then I look,
and it's like an hour later and I've done
nothing, okay?
So this smaller set of styles helps,
actually
helps people like me that are over
tinkerers.
And as far as I'm concerned, the default
style looks really nice.
And so I wouldn't, you know, it seems,
seems fine.
So that's actually a nice component of R
studio presenter.
And either with RStudio Presenter or
Slidify, you know, remember, ultimately
all this
is, is using R as a front end to create an
HTML5 slide deck.
So if you have a little CSS or HTML
knowledge, you
can make either RStudio Presenter or
Slidify as elaborate as you'd like.
And you know the, the big step is
deciding that you want a reproducible
presentation with R
embedded in your presentation building
software, and then I
think either of these solutions will work
quite well.
